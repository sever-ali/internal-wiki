🗂️ Internal Store Wiki — DevOps Project

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps workflow for deploying an internal wiki Flask application to an AWS EC2 instance.
It’s an extremely simple app (kind of like "Hello World") that will eventually be developed further to help stores with their IT issues and reduce ticekts coming to the Service Desk Team.

🚀 Tech Stack
	•	Python Flask — Internal wiki web app
	•	Docker + Docker Compose — Containerised Flask + Nginx reverse proxy
	•	Terraform — Provision AWS EC2 infrastructure
	•	Ansible — Configure server, deploy app with Docker Compose
	•	GitHub Actions — CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments on git push

✅ Key files:
	•	main.tf — provisions EC2 instance and SSH key pair
	•	inventory.ini — defines Ansible hosts (replace with your own IP)
	•	playbook.yml — installs Docker & runs Flask app via Compose
	•	deploy.yml — GitHub Actions pipeline for auto-deploy to EC2

⚙️ How It Works
	1.	Infrastructure:
	•	Run terraform apply to spin up your EC2 instance.
	•	Outputs the public IP you’ll SSH into.
	2.	Configuration:
	•	Update inventory.ini with your EC2 IP.
	•	Use your own .pem key (not included for security).
	3.	Deployment:
	•	GitHub Actions workflow connects via SSH & runs Ansible.
	•	Ansible sets up Docker, pulls the app, runs Compose with Nginx.
	4.	Access:
	•	Wiki app served via Nginx reverse proxy on port 80.

⸻

🔒 Important Notes
	•	No .pem file included — add your own SSH key & keep it out of version control.
	•	Hardcoded IP — you’ll need to update inventory.ini to match your EC2.
	•	Secrets — store your EC2_SSH_KEY and EC2_PUBLIC_IP in GitHub Actions secrets.
